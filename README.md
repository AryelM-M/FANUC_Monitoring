# Fanuc monitoring tool
Hello!

This is just a simple tool to use with the API that Raphael Quirion created to monitor the position and force of the TCP of the CRX-25-ia.
It is pretty simple to use, just launch main.py and use the simple options presented to navigate through the data.

If you want to monitor any CSV file used in this project, put it at the same level as main and type the name of the file in the visualize data section.

To install all the librarys, just create a virtual environnement using venv and type those two lines in the terminal

.venv/scripts/activatess

pip install -r requirements.txt
